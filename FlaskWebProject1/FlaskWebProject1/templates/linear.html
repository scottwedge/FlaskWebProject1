            <ul>
                <li>
                    Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship  <br />
                    between target and one or more predictors.
                <li>
                    The most common method for fitting a regression line is the method of least-squares.  <br />
                    This method calculates the best-fitting line for the observed data by  <br />
                    minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations  <br />
                    from each data point to the line.

            <h3><strong> Linear regression's metrics and coefficient:</strong></h3>
            <br />
            <h5><strong> Metrics:</strong></h5>
            <h5>R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. </h5>
            <h5>
                In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. <br />
            </h5>
            <h5><strong>R2: {{r2}}</strong></h5>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>MAE is the average of the absolute difference between the predicted values and observed value. </h5>
            <h5>A MAE of 0 means that your model is a perfect predictor of the outputs.</h5>
            <h5><strong>MAE: {{mae}}</strong></h5>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>
                mean square error is just like the MAE,  <br />
                but squares the difference before summing them all <br />
                instead of using the absolute value.
            </h5>
            <h5>A MSE of 0 means that your model is a perfect predictor of the outputs.</h5>
            <h5><strong>MSE: {{mse}}</strong></h5>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>
                Regression coefficients are estimates<br />
                of the unknown population parameters and describe<br />
                the relationship between a predictor variable and the response.<br />
            </h5>
            <h5><strong>coef: {{coef}}</strong></h5>
